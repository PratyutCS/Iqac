                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p>Experiential learning is defined as a process whereby knowledge is created through the
                        transformation of
                        experience in a particular context. Notwithstanding the many advantages of traditional teaching,
                        research las
                        shown that incorporating experiential learning in the pedagogy augments overall learning, builds
                        reflection
                        and
                        enhances decision-making capabilities. Well-designed experiential learning environments contain
                        pedagogical
                        elements that help the student explore, navigate, and comprehend more information about a
                        dynamic system that
                        cannot be obtained through the process of being passive listeners in class. It also improves
                        student-professor
                        interactions as the faculty now assumes the role of a master facilitator where learning is
                        generated within
                        the
                        group through a symbiotic and engaged process. Therefore, at BMU we pride ourselves in
                        delivering programs
                        that
                        are very high on experiential learning components to ensure our students learn while doing
                        things.</p>

                    <h3>Context</h3>
                    <p>In the days of yore, the source of knowledge for students across universities was rather limited.
                        Students either had to listen patiently to the professor in class or read the textbooks and
                        references or had to spend time physically in the library. With the advent of web-based
                        technologies, smart devices and the internet, the above constraint has been turned on its head.
                        Answers (whether good or bad) are now available at the click of a button. This information
                        revolution has impacted the education world with the millennial generation actively seeking
                        instant gratification to their curiosity. However, at the same time, several industry reports
                        point out that many of today's graduates have lower employability. For instance, in India alone,
                        the ratio of employable to unemployable graduates is 20:80 which is concerning. Many experts
                        point out that the (lack of) ability to apply the knowledge gained at haloed academic
                        institutions is one major Achilles heel in securing or sustaining a placement. Our firm belief
                        at BML Munjal University is that how we impart learning needs to change, needs to become more
                        student centric and should get the student as well as faculty equally involved in the process of
                        learning and knowledge facilitation. As a progressive, forward-thinking University, we believe
                        that the new crop of students requires a very different pedagogical approach which is much more
                        hands on and experientially driven rather than a mere one-way delivery of knowledge.

                        courses. All the courses have experiential learning component varying from 10%
                        to 60%. This includes learning through case studies, simulations, gaming, practical
                        exercises, site visits, group discussions, technical writings, and seminars. Some
                        of the interesting initiatives are listed below.

                    <h3> Research Projects</h3>
                    <p> In engineering courses often, students are encouraged to work in research projects related to water
                        purification systems, solar energy and electric vehicles and legal issues around it. At BMU we believe
                        that these immersion activities improve a student's critical thinking and problem-solving abilities and
                        help them to build their future careers in an inter-disciplinary manner.</p>

                    <h3>Evidence of Success</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The implementation of experiential learning benefitted both the students and the University alike. The
                        positive outcomes reflected on various frontiers. One of the key indicators of the success of any University
                        historically has been the employability quotient. Although there is no particular parameter to evaluate
                        employability quotient, placement records and corporate feedback indeed serves as an important proxy. The
                        placements in terms of numbers as well as the average pay package has improved over the years. This healthy
                        situation coupled with the very positive reviews from the employers and corporates we work with at the School,
                        indicates that our approach to learning and student academic experience is helping us reach our mission one
                        step at a time. Some testimonials are given below,

                          Additionally faculty members from the University have been constantly rewarded and recognized at several national
                          and international platforms for the experiential pedagogical initiatives they practice. Many student projects
                          have been jointly published with faculty members. Our Incubator has more than 20 start ups at different stages
                          of inception. Needless to mention the vibrant campus atmosphere that is created and the improvement in student
                          experience with the program.

                    <h3>Problems Encountered and Resources Required</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Tmplementation of experiential learning initiatives requires faculty members to be very flexible and adaptive
                        in their style of teaching. Additionally, it also requires various departments within the University to
                        cohesively work in enhancing student learning experience. Indeed, that is a key challenge. However at BMU we
                        have our Center for Teaching Learning and Development that organizes multiple sensitization and training
                        workshops
                        for faculty members all-round the year. Additionally aligning the assessments for these experiential
                        initiatives requires objectivity, therefore faculty members constantly adhere to OBE aligned frameworks.
                        Finally, some of these initiatives are capital intensive and requires budget approvals from appropriate heads.
