                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p>Over the years BML Munjal University has crafted its place in the Indian Higher Education context
                        as a
                        university that creates successful entrepreneurs and change-makers. The entrepreneurship
                        ecosystem at BMU is
                        intended to help students graduate as innovators with an entrepreneurial mindset in a constantly
                        changing
                        global scenario. Students develop the investigative capability to use the founding principles of
                        the
                        University, the 3 I's: Inquire, Inspire, and Impact to address real-world problems. Therefore,
                        BMU aspires to
                        be the University where startups can be founded with all the support required - be it
                        infrastructure,
                        mentoring, guidance, industry connections, etc. To achieve these outcomes the University offers
                        programs,
                        courses, events, challenges, and other engagements to ignite the spirit of innovation and
                        entrepreneurship
                        among students, faculty, and the community. There is a constant endeavor to provide access to a
                        network with
                        entrepreneurs, mentors, experts, and service providers that can be leveraged for the benefit of
                        budding
                        start-ups. Additionally, there is an active engagement of the industry in the innovation
                        activities being
                        conducted by the University for translational research, collaboration with academia,
                        policymaking etc. for the
                        creation of research-based knowledge around innovation and entrepreneurship.</p>

                    <h3>Context</h3>
                    <p>The University's curriculum since its inception has core courses designed to inculcate
                        entrepreneurial
                        thinking in students across the various schools of the University. Ingraining Interdisciplinary
                        thinking has
                        been an underlying philosophy that BMU has espoused to its community. BMU launched its Institute
                        of Innovation
                        and Entrepreneurship (I2E) in 2019 with 12E envisaged being the nodal center pan-university for
                        innovation and
                        entrepreneurship-related activities. The University also inaugurated its incubator Propel and
                        the Institute
                        Innovation Council the same year under the aegis of I2E.
                        Activities to promote Entrepreneurship are categorized into three broad heads Curriculum and
                        Research, Extra
                        Curricula as well as Incubation, and Outreach. There were myriad challenges ranging from
                        provisioning
                        intellectual resources, navigating the architecture of individual schools for embedding courses,
                        exciting
                        faculty to participate in research, converting student projects into Innovation projects, and
                        developing a
                        network of mentors and partner institutions to support incubates at the incubation Centre,
                  
                    developing connections with the local industry to translational research among others, However the
                    University has been successful in implementation of many initiatives towards its end goal.

                    <h3>The Practice</h3>

                    <p>The practice of Entrepreneurial Learning is guided by the principle of - Project (Experiential
                        Learning) -
                        Paper ( Applied Research )
                        - Prototype ( Tinkering and Experimentation ) -
                        Product ( Technology Development )- Venture Creation ( Technology Commercialization ). BMU aims
                        to impart Three
                        Levels of
                        Entrepreneurial Learning: Imbibing an Entrepreneurial Mindset irrespective of Career Choice;
                        Learning the
                        skill of creating a venture within a corporate and Cultivating the skill of sustaining and
                        growing a venture (
                        Incubation and acceleration ). All students at BMU undergo a self-awareness module at the time
                        of orientation
                        to make them aware of their current mode of thinking and how it maps to the growth mindset
                        required to Imbibe
                        the triad of Inspire, Inquire, and Impact. Thus the Entrepreneurial Learning is categorized into
                        three
                        dimensions:

                    <h3> Learning through Extra Circular Activities</h3>
                    <p> Applying knowledge gained through the above two components E.g.: Submitting a business plan/
                        incubation proposal, organizing events related to the IE area, getting certified through an
                        external agency in the I area, and other such activities notified by I2E
                        These dimensions are progressive in nature and entrepreneurial learning is expected to increase
                        as students transition from teaching to co-circular and finally to extra circular activities.
                        The student has an opportunity through these activities to be a part of the pipeline to the
                        pre-incubator at the University (ACIC) or the incubator (Propel) based on their level of
                        preparedness with the idea. BMU has also launched a Major / Minor in Entrepreneurship at the
                        master's level ( MBA Program ) in its School of Management from AY 22-23 and a Minor in
                        Entrepreneurship at the undergraduate in the School of Engineering and Technology.</p>

                    <h3>Evidence of Success</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The University efforts have been recognized by the government and
                        ecosystem partners. Our Institute
                        Innovation Council has been given the highest rating by Innovation Cell, Ministry of Education
                        ever since its
                        inception in
                        2019. The University has been chosen to be a mentee institution to five other institutions of
                        Higher Education
                        in the country namely - TERI institute of advanced studies, IHMR Jaipur, ITM Sonipat, MIET
                        Meerut, and Hansraj
                        College Delhi University. BMU has secured a grant from Border Mission Limited of USS 250000
                        spread over five
                        years for creating a Chair in Innovation and Entrepreneurship at the University. A grant of INR
                        2.5 crores has
                        been received from NITI AYOG for setting up a Pre-Incubation facility titled Atal Community
                        Innovation Centre
                        (ACIC). BMU has matched this grant with its resources. At present the University has over twenty
                        startups
                        being incubated at Propel and ACIC. Batx, one of the incubated startups has got its seed round
                        funding and is
                        valued at INR 40 crores. The University also has provisions of Startup and Innovation Policy,
                        IPR Policy,
                        Deferred Placement Policy, and Incubation Policy as a part of the statute of the University. In
                        addition to
                        several activities to imbibe an entrepreneurial atmosphere within the campus there is also a
                        provision of Demo
                        Day by Incubator and Innovation Days by respective Schools on experiential projects.

                    <h3>Problems Encountered and Resources Required</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">To enable the initiatives BMU currently has the Institute of
                        Innovation and Entrepreneurship(12E) with three
                        full-time staff members: a Chair Professor of Innovation and Entrepreneurship at 12E and SOM,
                        CEO for our
                        Incubation center and ACIC - Coordinator. In addition, 12E is collaborating with other schools
                        in the
                        University and is attracting faculties for dual affiliation with 12E and the parent-school. Some
                        of the key
                        challenges faced by the University is in terms of reaching critical mass is ensuring Faculty and
                        student
                        participation in the I activities and increasing the number of incubated companies. To address
                        these
                        challenges, we believe inputs are needed in terms of Investment towards sensitizing of faculty
                        towards I and
                        training of interested faculty to become instructors in this area. Focus is required on the
                        mindset of
                        students at the intake level to attract as a percentage of total intake students with the seed
                        of an
                        entrepreneurial mindset. And finally, provisions of Investment Fund for incubating companies
                        needs to be
                        explored as it is the single most important factor to attract new incubates.
