          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">BML Munjal university (BMU) is a financially sustainable university where
            there is a singular focus
            on ensuring students as the epicenter. BMU characterizes itself with creating leaders who possess
            lifelong learning skills thus leading to holistic development of students. The three guiding
            principles of the university are Inspire, Inquiry and Impact, which are intrinsic to our graduate
            attributes. The graduating students are defined by a profile consisting of good citizenry, global
            outlook, analytical abilities, design oriented, chnology savvy, problem solver, practically sound,
            industry oriented, innovation focused and entrepreneurial attitude, and interdisciplinary.</p>

          <h3>Holistic Development through Interdisciplinary Outlook</h3>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">We are a comprehensive university, wherein the co-location of disciplinary
            schools, each specializing in specific disciplines, on a single campus, allows students to pursue
            interdisciplinary studies and work at the interfaces of disciplines. Students develop expertise in crafting
            solutions to problems more broadly, without feeling regimented by their disciplinary boundaries. The
            comprehensive setting allows cross-fertilization of ideas and helps students acquire a T-shaped education to
            gain depth in their discipline as well as to learn, collaborate and communicate with people outside the
            discipline. Together with this, we also emphasize on good communication skills, values and inculcating a
            lifelong sense of curiosity.</p>

          <h3>Holistic Development through Course Curriculum</h3>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Accordingly, the curricula at BMU are hugely flexible based on the philosophy
            of Choice Based Credit
            System and Outcome Based Education, wherein students may choose courses and specializations from
            within and outside of their parent discipline. The curricular design is innovative and contemporary
            in content and has regional, national, and global perspective to foster national/world view. It also
            includes 'enrichment courses' and 'value added courses' for holistic development of the students and
            to make them better citizens. Each programme therefore has a basket of skills and perspective
            courses in the curricula with the objective of blending liberal studies with business/technical
            curricula to produce graduates with a liberal bent. Some components that are embedded include
            Critical Thinking, Historical Perspective, Basic Public Policy, Art Appreciation, Elements of Social
            and Applied Psychology, and Literature. The exposure to such courses provides graduates to develop
            abilities to think about and deal with the increasingly "VUCA" (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and
            Ambiguous) world.</p>

        <div class="contentMain">
          <h3>Holistic Development through Experiential Learning</h3>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Students spend over 45% of their time in experiential learning by way of
            laboratory works, field
            visits, projects, case studies, gaming, simulations, mandatory internships (through our flagship
            practice school programme) to ensure real-life exposure, and industry and professional readiness.
            This approach is reinforced using technology, blended and flip classroom learning, and
            integration of MOOCs in the curricula.
            BMU Practice School is a powerful industry internship programme for students to experience state of
            art developments in industry. The overarching goal is not only limited to applying the knowledge and
            skills learnt in classroom in the real-life situations of industry but also to imbibe in them the
            courage and fortitude to experience the challenges of a professional workplace, improve
            communication and the ability to work in a team. The students and faculty work closely with industry
            in the areas of product development, productivity improvement and skill development. Joint
            internship mentoring leads to joint research and consultancy projects. The students can work part
            time in these projects through our work while study' programme.

          <h3>Holistic Development through Leadership Talks</h3>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Besides, the corporate and industry professionals work cohesively with the
            faculty throughout the
            year to co-teach the courses thus bringing in live problems and case studies inside the classrooms.
            Through the Leadership Lecture Series" BMU brings industry stalwarts to share their thoughts and
            experience with students.

          <h3>Holistic Development through Conducive Research Culture</h3>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Together with innovative pedagogy, the university has created a conducive
            research and enterprise
            culture of fundamental, inters-disciplinary, and applied research via funding through industry
            collaborations, from government agencies and joint research with foreign institutions. We have been
            recognized as a research active institute by the Department of Science and Technology and by Niti
            Aayog as valuable partners.The students are encouraged to publish research in high-quality journals
            and file patents. As much for their ability to inspire students in the classrooms, the faculty
            members take the rigor and relevance of their research from laboratories to the classroom. Thus, a
            concerted impetus is given in UG research. With a subscription to multiple databases, research
            journals including our own 'International Journal on Ethics and Business,
            students keep themselves abreast on new developments.

          <h3>Holistic Development through Entrepreneurial Initiatives</h3>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">To further promote the spirit of innovation amongst the students, the
            university has made significant
            investments in incubation and start-up infrastructure, embedding entrepreneurial courses in the
            curriculum, organizing events and creating alliances and network for driving the initiatives of
            innovation and entrepreneurial learning, one of the three strategic goals of the university. Our
            on-campus co-working space in the BMU incubator, called as 'Propel' has contemporary facilities
            required for supporting start-up ventures. The Propel offers incubation to BMU students intending to
            nurture their business ideas. The budding entrepreneurs get access to the entire university
            infrastructure like laboratories, workshops, digital learning resources and the library. Incubator
            has a distinguished set of mentors ranging from industry experts, serial entrepreneurs, incubation
            heads, angel investors and venture capitalists, and practicing academicians.
            Students get to meet the mentors to learn the nitty-gritties of company incorporation, validation a
            business model, formulation of go-to-market strategy, building a core team, and much more.
            <br>
            The university offers several entrepreneurship focused courses in the program curriculum of
            different schools.
            All these courses focus on hands on experiential learning to drive an innovative entrepreneurial
            mindset among the students. To take the initiatives to the next level annual flagship events and
            programs (e.g., The Pitchfest, The Hult Prize, Foundation Program for Aspiring Entrepreneurs, Heroes
            of Tomorrow, Hackathons etc.) are organized providing the vibrancy and momentum to support the
            innovation and entrepreneurial mindsets of the students.

          <h3>Holistic Development through Industry and Academic Collaborations</h3>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">The research and innovations have led to collaboration with more than 50

          <h3>Holistic Development through Centers of Excellences</h3>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">The students also take huge benefit from the industry-sponsored
            inter-disciplinary centers of
            excellence to work on industry-led problems. These include Shell Learning Centre in Lubricants and
            Tribology, Siemens Centre of Excellence in Automation, Robotics and Mechatronics, IBM Business
            Analytics Lab, AIMA Business Simulation lab, Centre for Sustainability and Financial Markets, Centre

          <h3>Holistic Development through Co-Curricular Activities</h3>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Further, an important facet of leadership is to engender team spirit, develop
            good communication and
            organization skills, appreciate cultural niceties of all regions and develop a positive attitude.
            While academics imparts the necessary knowledge, many leadership qualities are imbued through
            sports, cultural and other co-curricular activities to form a truly well-rounded personality.
            <br>
            The university has seamlessly integrated co-curricular activities with the curricula, and assigned
            credits, which allows students to participate in community services, and work on projects for the
            social good. These are executed through several cultural, research and innovation clubs, and
            technical societies. The financial support provided to the students to participate in many technical
            competitions, national and international conferences.

          <h3>Concluding Note</h3>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Clearly, with students as the centerpiece, the thrust of the university is on
            their holistic
            development, which is accomplished by creating a learning environment consisting of hugely flexible
            curricula, skills and perspective trainings, inter-disciplinary education, research and innovation,
            industrial internships through practice school, experiential learning, and co-curricular activities.
            All these lead to improving their abilities to perform well in the chosen profession, self-esteem,
            positive attitude, teamwork, responsibility, communication, and interpersonal skills required to
            make them leaders in the society, which is the vision of BMU.
